## INTERNET PROGRAMMING Lab Project'2017
## Objective
To create a dynamic intelligent platform for all graduate students from universities, so that each can be linked directly to their preferred and deserved area of jobs and higher study fields with ease, and efficiency. A lot of times we see (especially in Bangladesh) that a job offer or a Research Assistantship offer often don't reach the deserved candidate rather, the offer is given to the person favoured to the one with the news of the offer. Hence the deserving candidates often find it difficult to reach the platforms they deserve. Our objective is that every student would get a chance to display their expertise and achievements and interests in a public platform and the system would bring the best opportunities out there for them.
